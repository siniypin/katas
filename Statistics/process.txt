Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers
to determine the following statistics:

    o) minimum value
    o) maximum value
    o) number of elements in the sequence
    o) average value

For example: [6, 9, 15, -2, 92, 11]

    o) minimum value = -2
    o) maximum value = 92
    o) number of elements in the sequence = 6
    o) average value = 21.833333


1. when empty sequence should return empty stats +
2. when sequence of one item all stat items should be equal +
3. when sequence of many items should count correctly +
3. when sequence of many equal items all stat items should be equal +
4. when sequence of many distinct items should calculate correctly
	max +
	min +
	avg +

smell - array creation is repeated +
smell - creating empty stats in tests repeated +
