There are four types of common coins in US currency:
  quarters (25 cents)
  dimes (10 cents)
  nickels (5 cents) 
  pennies (1 cent)
  
There are 6 ways to make change for 15 cents:
  A dime and a nickel;
  A dime and 5 pennies;
  3 nickels;
  2 nickels and 5 pennies;
  A nickel and 10 pennies;
  15 pennies.
  
How many ways are there to make change for a dollar
using these common coins? (1 dollar = 100 cents).


design session: coin is an entity that has a nominal value
change with the given nominal is not always possible unless there is a nominal value of one

1. when change asked should calculate one result +
	100 with pennies +
	20 with nickels +
	10 with dimes +
	4 with quarters +
smell - data coupling with test - generalize algorythm for coins counting

design session: dollar is just a number of cents, change is asked for cents. in other words don't restrict algorythm to expect dollars only.

2. when change asked for 5 cents with two nominal values, pennies and nickels, should return two options + 
		5 0
		0 1
triangulate to generalize algorythm for two coins
3. when change asked for 10 cents with two denominations, pennies and nickels, should return three options +
		10 0
		5 1
		0 2

smell: code is getting ugly - need to comment
refactor +

4. when change asked for 15 cents with three denominations, pennies, nickels and dimes, should return four options
		15 0 0
		10 1 0
		5 2 0
		5 0 1
5. when change asked for 20 cents with three denominations, pennies, nickels and dimes, should return xxx options
		20 0 0
		15 1 0
		10 2 0
		10 0 1
		5 1 1
		5 3 0
		0 4 0
		0 0 2
