Tests to verify behavior:
1. Correctly spelling out digits
2. Correctly spelling out numbers 11-19
3. Correctly spelling out numbers 20-99
4. Correctly spelling out numbers 100-999
5. Same for thousands
6. Same for millions

to avoid repetition in algorythm for every other digit lets create a grammar map, containing unique terms for numbers

teens are unique terms on their own
it appears that numbers 16-19 are not unique terms, but rather a concatenation of digit and "teen", thus
2 breaks down into:
	spell numbers 11-15 correctly
	numbers 16-19 are concatenation of respected digit spelled and "teen"

it appears that dozens are unique terms on their own as well, thus 
3 breaks down into:
	spell rounded numbers 20,30,..90 correctly
	spell unrounded numbers greater 20 and less then 100 correctly
it appears again that 60,70..90 are not unique terms, but rather a concatenation of digit and "ty", thus
spell rounded numbers 20,30,..90 correctly breaks down into: 
	spell rounded numbers 20,30,40,50 correctly
	rounded numbers 60,70,..90 are concatenation of respected digit spelled and "ty"
ugh, it doesn't work for eighty
let's add another test to verify eighty as unique term
finally, 3 is broken down into
	spell rounded numbers 20,30,40,50,80 correctly
	rounded numbers 60,70,90 are concatenation of respected digit spelled and "ty"
	spell unrounded numbers greater 20 and less then 100 as dozen and digit spelled out one after another

I feel a smell - repetitions in tests. postpone it for later

hundreds doesn't have uniqueness in terms 
the algorythm is unclear have to refactor it	

thousands a pretty much the same as handreds and millions as well
there are repetitions in algorythm with slight variations.
will not generalize the algorythm as it is still constrained with knowledge about number orders and it obviously has to be configured anywhere, why not in code.
as for repeating pattern in spell_smth this one can be refactored with ruby neat features.

now refactor repetitions in test

I forgot about ten!
have to add a test for it.

resulting list of tests:
1. Correctly spelling out digits
	tests for correctness per each digit
2. Correctly spelling out numbers 11-19
	tests for correctness of 10-15 numbers spelled
	test that 16-19 is spelled as concatenation of digit spelled and "teen"
3. Correctly spelling out numbers 20-99
	tests for correctness of 20,30,40,50,80 numbers spelled
	test that rounded numbers 60,70,90 are concatenation of respected digit spelled and "ty"
	test that unrounded numbers greater 20 and less then 100 are spelled as dozen and digit spelled out one after another
4. Correctly spelling out numbers 100-999
	test that 100,200,...,900 are spelled as digit spelled followed by "hundred"
	test that unrounded numbers greater 99 and less then 1000 are spelled as digit spelled follwed by "hundred" followed by dozen and digit spelled out one after another
5. thousands and millions are the same, but longer
