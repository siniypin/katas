Compare two IPv4 (i.e. 32-bit) CIDR ranges.

IPv4 Addresses

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit ID, made up of 4 bytes.

Format:
We will write the address in the standard "dotted decimal" format: Each byte (octet) is converted to its decimal value (which is always in the range 0 to 255) and those values are separated with dots.

Examples:
0xFFFFFFFF = 255.255.255.255
0xFF00FF01 = 255.0.255.1
0x10203040 = 16.32.48.64
0x00000000 = 0.0.0.0
CIDR Range

An IPv4 CIDR range identifies an IPv4 network (i.e. collection of IPv4 addresses). A CIDR range consists of an IPv4 address and a suffix indicating how many bits of the address make up the network mask. The suffix can be from 0 to 32 bits.

Format:
A CIDR range is written as:
[IPv4 Address]/[prefix bit count]

Examples:
192.168.0.1/22 
128.148.128.40/32
168.0.0.0/0
10.61.128.218/27
Only the Prefix of the IPv4 Address is Significant
Given the CIDR range 255.255.255.255/24 we know that only the first 24 bits of the IPv4 address make up the network mask. The bits which are not included in the network mask are not important.

A CIDR Range Has Multiple Representations
Because the address bits which are not part of the prefix aren't relevant there are multiple ways to write the same CIDR range. For example, these representations are equivalent:
255.255.255.255/24
255.255.255.0/24
255.255.255.100/24
(i.e. the addresses are identical for the first 24 bits, although the last 8 bits differ)

Comparing CIDR Ranges
Lets say we have two CIDR ranges A and B. Now, lets say we have LA and LB as prefix lengths for A and B respectively. Finally, say N = MIN (LA, LB). 
To determine if A is a subset of B, we have to determine if:
a) The prefix length of A is greater than B
b) The first N bits of the IPv4 addresses are the same.
Similarly, we can easily derive if A is equal to B or, A is superset of B or, A is disjoint of B.
Examples:
"23.45.67.89/16" is EQUAL to "23.45.255.255/16" (the prefix lengths match and the prefixes match)
"1.2.3.4/24" is SUBSET of "1.2.3.4/16" (the prefix lengths are different but prefixes match)
"172.84.26.128/16" is SUPERSET of "172.84.26.255/24" (the prefix lengths are different but prefixes match)
"197.54.16.128/25" is DISJOINT of "197.54.16.127/25" (the prefixes are different)
